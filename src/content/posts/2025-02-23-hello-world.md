**Hello, World!**

Hi there! I'm thrilled to launch my very own (new) blogging platform. After spending time on micro-blogging platforms, and a while self-hosting Ghost, I've decided to move away from social networks and create a space where I can express myself more freely and openly. Ghost was a great platform to write long articles, but it felt inappropriate for short updates or heavy customization.

I started developing my own theme, but when I saw how good [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) was, I couldn't resist using it.

Here’s what you can expect from my blog:

- **Short and Sweet Posts**: Think microblogging but less social media focused. I’ll be sharing quick thoughts, snippets of code, or interesting links I come across throughout my day.
- **Thoughtful Quotes**: If I stumble upon an intriguing article or paper, I might feature a compelling quote to spark some reflection.
- **Programming Projects**: Updates on side projects I’m tinkering with. I’ll highlight challenges and solutions, giving a glimpse behind the scenes of my coding adventures.

I want to show a bit of who I am, and sharing my thoughts and learnings, in case it could help anyone out there. I hope I'll feel at home here, like I used to on microbbloging platforms.
