Hey everyone,

I've been searching for the perfect image hosting solution for my blog, and I finally found it! Meet [Slink](https://github.com/andrii-kryvoviaz/slink), a self-hosted image sharing platform that actually gets it right.

Here's what had me hooked: it strips EXIF data from images automatically. You know, all that metadata that can reveal your location, camera model, and other personal info? Gone. This is something I really needed, especially since [PicoShare](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare) (which I use for other needs, keeping this lack of feature in mind) keeps files exactly as uploaded.EXIF data and all.

But it's not just about privacy. The UI/UX is great. Upload an image, get a clean link, done. No fuss, no bloated interface, just a smooth experience that makes adding images to my static blog actually enjoyable. It supports everything from PNG and JPG to modern formats like AVIF and HEIC.

I've already uploaded a bunch of images for my previous posts to Slink (you're looking at one right now!). Having complete control over my media while keeping things private and simple? That's exactly what I was after.

If you're tired of wrestling with image hosting or worried about metadata privacy, give [Slink](https://github.com/andrii-kryvoviaz/slink) a shot. It's been a game-changer for my workflow.
