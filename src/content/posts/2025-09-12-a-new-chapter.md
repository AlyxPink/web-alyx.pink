Hey everyone,

I've launched [3615.computer](https://3615.computer), my new umbrella for software projects. The name's a nod to those funny little [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel) "computers" we had at home in France—our own internet before the internet, where you'd dial "3615" for services over the landline.

Right now, I'm focusing on two main projects that solve very different problems I care about.

# Workunit: AI for Focused Teams

[**Workunit**](https://workunit.app/) tackles a problem I've experienced firsthand—context fragmentation. You know the drill: scattered conversations across Slack, decisions buried in email threads, and that one crucial detail lost somewhere in your note-taking app.

Workunit consolidates your team's scattered tools into one AI-powered workspace. Think of it as having a thoughtful team member who remembers every decision, understands your project's context, and helps you stay focused instead of constantly context-switching.

It's built for small teams and solo entrepreneurs who want AI assistance without the complexity.

# Aeronef: Guild Wars 2 Companion

[**Aeronef**](https://aeronef.app/) started as a personal itch I needed to scratch. As a Guild Wars 2 player, I was tired of juggling multiple wikis, calculators, and spreadsheets to track my progress and manage my in-game economy.

So I built a comprehensive companion app that handles account value tracking, crafting calculations, daily quest management, and real-time trading post analytics—all in one place. It's built by a gamer, for gamers, with no affiliation to ArenaNet.

If you're managing multiple characters or trying to optimize your gold-making strategies, Aeronef might save you some headaches.
