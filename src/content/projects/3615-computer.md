  I've been quietly working on something new, an umbrella company called 3615.computer to house my software projects. Workunit is our main product, focusing on AI-powered project management. Aeronef is a fun side project for Guild Wars 2 enthusiasts. It's a big step, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes us!
