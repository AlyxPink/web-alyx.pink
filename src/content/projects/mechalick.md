Mechalick brings colorful mechanical keyboards to the French market. While most retailers offer only black gaming keyboards with aggressive RGB, Mechalick focuses on vibrant aesthetics - pastel themes, bold color combinations, and builds designed to bring personality to your desk.

## Pre-Built and DIY Options

Mechalick offers both pre-built keyboards and DIY kits. Pre-built keyboards come ready to use, pre-modified with lubed switches, tuned stabilizers, and acoustic foam - no assembly required, no technical expertise needed. DIY kits provide all the components for those who want to build their own, while still benefiting from curated colorful parts and French stock availability.

The goal is making mechanical keyboards accessible to everyone, whether you want something beautiful that works out of the box, or prefer assembling it yourself.

All products ship from French stock with customer service in French, offering fast delivery and reliable warranties - eliminating the typical trade-offs between quality, aesthetics, and local service.

## Try Before You Commit

Mechalick's switch testing program solves a common problem: how do you know which switches you'll like without buying a dedicated tester that gets used once then forgotten?

The approach is simple - pay for a full switch set, receive samples to test at home. If you like them, keep them or get your complete keyboard built. If not, return the samples and get a full refund minus return shipping costs. No waste, no expensive single-use testers, no risk of ordering 70 switches you'll regret.

## The Platforms

The project operates through multiple platforms: [mechalick.com](https://mechalick.com) serves as the main landing page and community hub, while [shop.mechalick.com](https://shop.mechalick.com) is a fully custom-built e-commerce platform with product filtering, localization, and complete shopping functionality.

Content, builds, and community engagement happen primarily on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mecha.lick/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mechalick), showcasing keyboard aesthetics, setup inspiration, and educational content about mechanical keyboards.

## The Philosophy

Mechanical keyboards shouldn't be intimidating or exclusive. Mechalick creates a space where aesthetics matter as much as specifications, where beginners feel welcome, and where having fun with your setup is encouraged.

The logo is a lollipop - colorful, playful, approachable. Because at its core, Mechalick believes keyboards should be fun.
