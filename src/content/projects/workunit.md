<ul>
  <li><b>Universal Context Layer:</b> Share context across Claude, GPT, Gemini, and any AI model that supports MCP</li>
  <li><b>No More Context Loss:</b> Stop explaining the same things over and over as conversations get compressed</li>
  <li><b>Assets & Context Graph:</b> LLMs can create, search, and update your project's knowledge, systems, and documentation</li>
  <li><b>Team Collaboration:</b> Work together with humans and AI from a shared source of truth</li>
  <li><b>MCP Integration:</b> Works with any MCP-compatible tool - Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I built Workunit to solve a problem I kept hitting: AI models losing context, no way to share work between different LLMs, and teams having scattered conversations across tools. It's a context and memory layer that sits between you and any AI model, making collaboration seamless.
