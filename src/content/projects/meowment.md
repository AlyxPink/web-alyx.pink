<ul>
  <li>A slow paced social network where you can share more than ephemeral posts.</li>
  <li>Gives your creation the space it deserved through collections.</li>
  <li>Share Meowments with your friends. It could be a memory, a collection of your favorite moments during a trip, anything that is part of you and you'd love to share.</li>
</ul>
