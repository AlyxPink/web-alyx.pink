<p>Just a quick script I made that you might have to adapt for your situation, if you want to update any commits you made on all your projects, to remove your deadname and/or old email address.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Map your name and email address with your old ones so you can replace them easily</li>
  <li>Update all your commits</li>
  <li>Sign them again</li>
  <li>and add a new remote to your repositories.</li>
  <li>Do a quick check before confirming the operation to push force `--with-lease`</li>
</ul>
