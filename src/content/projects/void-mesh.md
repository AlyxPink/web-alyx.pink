<ul>
    <li><b>Idle Gameplay:</b> Enjoy the game at your pace, perfect for casual play.</li>
    <li><b>Open Source:</b> Dive into the code, contribute, or fork it to create your own version.</li>
    <li><b>Community-Driven:</b> Built on ActivityPub to enhance interaction and collaboration.</li>
    <li><b>Cross-Platform:</b> Play on any device, anywhere, seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very amibitious project, I've been iterating on drafts to refine the idea, to find a balance between a fun game and how to use ActivityPub for good reasons, not just a gimmick. Nothing is set in stone yet, but I'm excited to see where this goes!</p>
