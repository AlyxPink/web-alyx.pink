# 🧰 My Projects

I have a bunch of project on the side, for fun, for staying creative, for learning new things, or for solving real problems. It's not always finished, polished, and never done for sure, but I love them and I love sharing them.

<p>
  I've been quietly working on something new, an umbrella company called 3615.computer to house my software projects. Workunit is our main product, focusing on AI-powered project management. Aeronef is a fun side project for Guild Wars 2 enthusiasts. It's a big step, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes us!

### The missing context layer for working with AI

<img src="https://slink.alyx.pink/image/3a3982cd-661e-4a6b-96e8-f459c17b0bdb.png" />

<ul>
  <li><b>Universal Context Layer:</b> Share context across Claude, GPT, Gemini, and any AI model that supports MCP</li>
  <li><b>No More Context Loss:</b> Stop explaining the same things over and over as conversations get compressed</li>
  <li><b>Assets & Context Graph:</b> LLMs can create, search, and update your project's knowledge, systems, and documentation</li>
  <li><b>Team Collaboration:</b> Work together with humans and AI from a shared source of truth</li>
  <li><b>MCP Integration:</b> Works with any MCP-compatible tool - Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I built Workunit to solve a problem I kept hitting: AI models losing context, no way to share work between different LLMs, and teams having scattered conversations across tools. It's a context and memory layer that sits between you and any AI model, making collaboration seamless.
</p>

<p>
  Currently in beta and completely free while I refine things. Read more: <a href="/posts/2025-10-24-workunit-missing-context-layer-for-ai/">Workunit: The missing context layer for working with AI</a>

### A project I had in my mind and I had no idea how to create until it clicked!

<img src="https://github.com/AlyxPink/minecraft-screenshot-bot/raw/main/docs/img/banner.png">

<ul>
  <li>Capture and share the beauty of Minecraft landscapes!</li>
  <li>This script launches Minecraft, takes screenshots, uses an AI to describe them for accessibility purposes, and posts them to Mastodon with the generated alt-text.</li>
</ul>

## [😺 Meowment](https://github.com/meowment-app/)
<h3>Meowment is a new Fediverse social network, compatible with <b>ActivityPub</b>, to share more than just microblogging posts with your friends.</h3>

<img src="https://github.com/AlyxPink/AlyxPink/assets/152620834/00ac368e-bd07-49f8-a1a5-5719a95dc4e0">
<ul>
  <li>A slow paced social network where you can share more than ephemeral posts.</li>
  <li>Gives your creation the space it deserved through collections.</li>
  <li>Share Meowments with your friends. It could be a memory, a collection of your favorite moments during a trip, anything that is part of you and you'd love to share.</li>
</ul>

## [🌃 Void Mesh](https://github.com/VoidMesh)
<h3>🎮 First-ever idle game on the Fediverse powered by ActivityPub!</h3>

<img src="https://github.com/AlyxPink/AlyxPink/assets/152620834/7ae0200c-9606-4d7c-8a3b-27a02cede080">
<ul>
    <li><b>Idle Gameplay:</b> Enjoy the game at your pace, perfect for casual play.</li>
    <li><b>Open Source:</b> Dive into the code, contribute, or fork it to create your own version.</li>
    <li><b>Community-Driven:</b> Built on ActivityPub to enhance interaction and collaboration.</li>
    <li><b>Cross-Platform:</b> Play on any device, anywhere, seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very amibitious project, I've been iterating on drafts to refine the idea, to find a balance between a fun game and how to use ActivityPub for good reasons, not just a gimmick. Nothing is set in stone yet, but I'm excited to see where this goes!</p>

## [🐳 Docker Hub CLI](https://github.com/AlyxPink/docker-hub-cli)

<p>I built this during an hackathon when I was working at Docker Inc. but I haven't work a lot on it since. But the TUI is 👌. It's designed to browse Docker Hub and manage your account: (repositories, organizations, members, etc...)</p>

<p>Just a quick script I made that you might have to adapt for your situation, if you want to update any commits you made on all your projects, to remove your deadname and/or old email address.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Map your name and email address with your old ones so you can replace them easily</li>
  <li>Update all your commits</li>
  <li>Sign them again</li>
  <li>and add a new remote to your repositories.</li>
  <li>Do a quick check before confirming the operation to push force `--with-lease`</li>
</ul>
