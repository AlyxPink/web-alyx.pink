# About me

# Hi, I'm Alyx! 👋 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️

<img src="https://blog.alyx.pink/content/images/2023/12/1--1--1.jpeg" align="right" alt="Me, lying down in the grass, with a black cap and a white shirt. My arm is behind my head. It's a sunny day." width="25%">

Born in the 90's, I work in the tech industry since 2014.

After being a Ruby on Rails Engineer early in my career, and then going on the SysOps side of things full-time, I'm now a Senior Infrastructure Engineer working for an American tech company.

My first computer had a Pentium II 233MHz and ran Windows 95, I was around 8 at the time. We upgraded some stuff along the years, like adding a 3dfx Voodoo 3000 GPU (I think) and upgrading to Windows 98 SE. I have some blurry memories about upgrading our hard drive to a huge one, like... 3GB. It was crazy to me at the time. _Note that I might be wrong on the hardware specs, it was so long ago!_

Internet was starting to be a thing in my home. We were early adopter and had a 56k line for a very long time. Far too long. I remember eMule, the search engine [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista), and Google starting to be the go-to search engine.

A friend gave me a pirated CD of some MS-DOS games that clearly was not for my age. I was so scared to play some of them, in the dark attic where the computer was. I was playing [Hexen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexen:_Beyond_Heretic), [Prince Of Persia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)>), [Z](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(video_game)>), [Abuse](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_(video_game)>), [Tyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrian_%28video_game%29) and others I can't remember of... I'm really glad I made a ISO copy and still have the copy somewhere. _I should try to run these games again_ 🤔

I also remember being giften the game [The Incredible Machine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine_(1993_video_game)>). I think that game picked my interest in engineering stuff. I was really into building contraptions after that, making schema of impossible contraptions doing useless stuff, just for the sake of it.

Since then, I've been fascinated by how computers work. I've started playing video games, having to troubleshoot why they were not running, then working with hardware, and finally, writing code early in my teenage years.

# 🤗 Hobbies & Interests

**🧑‍💻 Programming**:
I enjoy coding, it's relaxing outside of work. Currently, I'm learning more about Golang and having a great time with it.

**🎶 Music**:
I've started making music with Korg Volca synths. It's a new adventure for me, not an easy one but again, it's all about enjoying what you are doing 😊

**👾 Gaming**:
Minecraft has been my favorite game since 2010. Overwatch is another game I play a lot, enjoying all roles.

**🔈 Hi-Fi enjoyer (but not an elitist one)**:
I appreciate good sound quality in music and movies and have invested in some nice speakers for that. I love to share them with my friends, it's always an amazing feeling to see their face smiling while listening to one of their favorite song or album and discovering the tracks again. I'm really glad I can share that.

**☕️ 🫖Coffee & Tea**:
Coffee starts my day, made with my trusty Jura machine. Sometimes, I switch to black tea for a change, [Mariage Frères](https://www.mariagefreres.com) have such a great selection.

**💃 Techno Music & Clubbing**:
I found out very late in my life that all of this scene existed. And it felt like I was waiting for that all my life. It's a place where I can dance freely, be myself, dress however I want, and forget everything else. I met a lot of nice people there. It feels like it's the only [third-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) where I can go to and socialize.

# 🧰 Some of my projects

I enjoy starting new projects, though finishing them is my biggest challenge. Check out my pinned repositories and the organization I'm part of to see how many unfinished projects I have 😭.

## [📸 Minecraft Screenshot Bot](https://github.com/AlyxPink/minecraft-screenshot-bot)

### A project I had in my mind and I had no idea how to create until it clicked!

<img src="https://github.com/AlyxPink/minecraft-screenshot-bot/raw/main/docs/img/banner.png">

<ul>
  <li><i>Capture and share the beauty of Minecraft landscapes!</i></li>
  <li><i>This script launches Minecraft, takes screenshots, uses an AI to describe them for accessbility purposes, and posts them to Mastodon with the generated alt-text.</i></li>
</ul>

Check out [some examples of screenshots](https://github.com/AlyxPink/minecraft-screenshot-bot?tab=readme-ov-file#-sample-screenshots) generated by this bot.

## [😺 Meowment](https://github.com/meowment-app/)
<h3>Meowment is a new Fediverse social network, compatible with <b>ActivityPub</b>, to share more than just microblogging posts with your friends.</h3>

<img src="https://github.com/AlyxPink/AlyxPink/assets/152620834/00ac368e-bd07-49f8-a1a5-5719a95dc4e0">
<ul>
  <li>A slow paced social network where you can share more than ephemeral posts.</li>
  <li>Gives your creation the space it deserved through collections.</li>
  <li>Share Meowments with your friends. It could be a memory, a collection of your favorite moments during a trip, anything that is part of you and you'd love to share.</li>
</ul>

## [🌃 Void Mesh](https://github.com/VoidMesh)
<h3>🎮 First-ever idle game on the Fediverse powered by ActivityPub!</h3>

<img src="https://github.com/AlyxPink/AlyxPink/assets/152620834/7ae0200c-9606-4d7c-8a3b-27a02cede080">
<ul>
    <li><b>Idle Gameplay:</b> Enjoy the game at your pace, perfect for casual play.</li>
    <li><b>Open Source:</b> Dive into the code, contribute, or fork it to create your own version.</li>
    <li><b>Community-Driven:</b> Built on ActivityPub to enhance interaction and collaboration.</li>
    <li><b>Cross-Platform:</b> Play on any device, anywhere, seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very amibitious project, I've been iterating on drafts to refine the idea, to find a balance between a fun game and how to use ActivityPub for good reasons, not just a gimmick. Nothing is set in stone yet, but I'm excited to see where this goes!</p>

## [🐳 Docker Hub CLI](https://github.com/AlyxPink/docker-hub-cli)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2109178/180596993-6b6638d8-6dfb-4a84-9bc8-172f282e8af3.png">

<p>I built this during an hackathon when I was working at Docker Inc. but I haven't work a lot on it since. But the TUI is 👌. It's designed to browse Docker Hub and manage your account: (repositories, organizations, members, etc...)</p>

::github{repo="AlyxPink/docker-hub-cli"}

## [🏳️‍⚧️ deadname_rewriter.sh](https://gist.github.com/AlyxPink/44dc3d4d72d520a344a316de3a109eca)

<img src="https://github.com/AlyxPink/AlyxPink/assets/152620834/bd69fca8-6247-4d5d-9d6d-6ab4e65e1578">

<p>Just a quick script I made that you might have to adapt for your situation, if you want to update any commits you made on all your projects, to remove your deadname and/or old email address.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Map your name and email address with your old ones so you can replace them easily</span>
  <li>Update all your commits</li>
  <li>Sign them again</li>
  <li>and add a new remote to your repositories.</li>
  <li>Do a quick check before confirming the operation to push force `--with-lease`</li>
</ul>
